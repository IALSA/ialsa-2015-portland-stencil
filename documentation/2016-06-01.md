Writing session for CAR poster



- .data and .csv are language-agnostic, tabulated data files
- .inp and .out are free-form, text file

- .csv belong to both private and public.

- catalog is a datasetin which each row represents one model per study.
- columns in this datasets are populated sequentially and are grouped into four sections:
- Part I - contains the responses  of the drivers to the PCS as they described their data
- Part II - contains model specification as Mplus syntax (that can be persisted in a file)
- Part III - contains model output from MPlus
- Part IV - columns with parameters parsed from Part III.


PCS is REDCap survey that interacts with the driver to obtain relevant description of the study 's dataset and characteristics.

**Creator** Script run on server. After the responses to PCS are entered, the Creator populates (values of the variables in) Part I of the Catalog.

PART I.

**Translator**. Script run on server. Using Part I it Mplus model syntax, which is uploaded to Part II.

PART II.

**Transcriber**. Script run on each driver's local machine.  Downloads model syntax from Part II of the catalog, and saves it as an .inp file on the driver's local machine.

**Cruncher**. Script run on each driver's local machine.  Reads the catalog and determines which models still needs to be estimated.  {After verifying that the .inp file (and .dat) exists locally...}  It programmatically calls a local installation of M*plus*, which uses the local .dat and .inp files.  It returns an .out file containing the model solution.

**Horseman**. Script run on each driver's local machine.  Uploads the contents of the .out files to Part III.

PART III.

**Parser**. Script run on server.  Extracts the critical characteristics of the model solution from the M*plus* output (such as parameter estimates, fit indices, and the convergence status).  For each model, the resulting individual scalar values are saved as separate columns in a single row of Part IV.

PART IV.

**Prometheus**. Script run on server.  Copies the entire catalog as a CSV on the driver's local machine.  This disconnected CSV allows the participants to later run reports and meta-analyses with more independence.
